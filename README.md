This project is a library management system and it manages users (Students, Teachers, and external borrowers) and the various books that they borrow. This project is somewhat useful as it serves as a reinforcemenet of the knowledge that I already know about OOP in Java. But I also hope that this can be used for actual online library systems. It at its current iteration will lack a GUI element.
